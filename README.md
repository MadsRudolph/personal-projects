### 🔊 [Illuminate 7Mk2 - 3D-Printed Speaker Build](Projects/Illuminate%207Mk2%20-%20Speaker%20Build.md)

Building a pair of audiophile-grade 3D-printed bookshelf speakers from scratch.

**Status:** 🟡 Planning

**Key Specs:**
- **Drivers:** Dayton Audio RS180P-8 (7" woofer) + RST28F-4 (28mm tweeter)
- **Enclosure:** 3D-printed PLA (~4750g required)
- **Frequency Response:** 50Hz - 20kHz (-3dB)
- **Impedance:** 8Ω nominal
- **Amplifier:** Fosi Audio V3 (TPA3255-based Class D, 300W x 2 @ 4Ω)

## 🎓 Background

I'm a Diplomingeniør (B.Eng.) student at DTU studying Electrical Engineering with focus on:
- Analog & mixed-signal electronics
- Electroacoustics & transducers
- Power electronics (Class D amplifiers, SMPS)
- Digital signal processing

These projects combine my academic knowledge with hands-on building experience.
